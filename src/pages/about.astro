    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>
      I'm a Full stack developer with a robust expertise in front-end technologies, excelling in creating scalable web infrastructure and employs an extensive range of testing methods, including unit, e2e, and integration, to ensure the delivery of superior quality outputs.
      I have a special passion for UI and UX. My primary role involves constructing our client-side infrastructure, strengthening the foundations of our front-end codebase, and enhancing user interface designs. I possess solid experience in building design systems.
      Over the past few years, I have worked closely with both designers and developers to improve communication and collaboration between the two teams. I consider the creation and delivery of tools, patterns, components, and guidelines for designers and developers to be a crucial part of my work.
